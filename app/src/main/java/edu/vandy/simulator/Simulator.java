/**
 * This class is the main controller for the simulation. It acts as a
 * mediator between the {@link BeingManager} and the {@link
 * PalantiriManager} implementations. Since all requests to acquire
 * and release Palantiri are routed through this class it is a
 * convenient place to check the running simulation for
 * inconsistencies which frees the Being manager to focus more on the
 * implementation details of each specific strategy and less on
 * whether that strategy is implemented correctly.
 * <p>
 * The Simulator is also responsible for managing its own model state
 * and calls the model layers setState method to trigger a snapshot
 * that will be sent to the presentation layer.  The BeingManager and
 * PalantiriManager base classes and all concrete class
 * implementations have no knowledge of state and can therefore only
 * need to include the implementation details of the specific
 * concurrency strategy that they are using/modelling.
 * <p>
 * This class also acts as a sink for all component {@link #error} and
 * {@link #warn} method invocations and is the initiator (starting
 * point) of all {@link #shutdown} and {@link #reset} requests that
 * get forwarded to all model components.
