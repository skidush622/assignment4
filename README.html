<h3>Java ConcurrentHashMap and Fair Semaphore (Assignment 4)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objectives of this assignment are to learn how to synchronize
beings (implemented using Android AsyncTasks) via a ConcurrentHashMap
and a fair semaphore (implemented using the <A
REF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf">Specific
Notification</A> pattern).  Videos describing the relevant topics
appear as follow:

<UL>
<LI> <B>Java ConcurrentHashMap</B> -- <A
HREF="https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java/lecture/lV76V/4-4-concurrent-hash-map">here</a>.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Specific Notification pattern</B> -- <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fegw8P8o5FI">here</a>.
</UL>

I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand these Java
synchronizers.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will use a ConcurrentHashMap and
the Specific Notification pattern to enhance the
AsyncTask/ThreadPoolExecutor implementation of the PalantiriSimulator
app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</A>. Assignment 4 focuses on the PalantiriManager, which is used to
restrict the number of beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently
gaze into a fixed number of palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project in Android
Studio version 3.x.  This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and
demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.

For the purposes of Assignment 4, however, you only need to be aware
of the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of JUnit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/asyncTask">asyncTask</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>asyncTask</CODE> skeleton and
use it as implementation of the BeingManager for Assignment 4 (make
sure to address all my comments from Assignment 3 into your Assignment
4 solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 24, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 24. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore">concurrentMapFairSemaphore</A> folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr.java">ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
PalantiriManager via a ConcurrentHashMap and a FairSemaphore.
</P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreMO.java">FairSemaphoreMO.java</A>. Undergraduate
students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a ``fair semaphore'' using built-in Java monitor
objects. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreCO.java">FairSemaphoreCO.java</A>. Graduate
students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a ``fair semaphore'' using Java ReentrantLocks and
ConditionObjects. </P>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered "correct" if all beings successfully
complete all their N iterations. A "correct" simulation should
restrict the number of gazing beings to the number of palantiri.  In
other words, if there are four palantiri in the simulation, then only
four beings should ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show palantiri and being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct and does not throw any exceptions the app title bar labels
will appear green when the simulation completes. If the implementation
throws an exception or is not implemented correctly when the
simulation completes the red title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to get you familiar with
synchronizing multi-threaded programs using Java ConcurrentHashMaps
and the Specific Notification pattern. </P>
